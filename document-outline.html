  	<p>The author of this blog post: http://www.creativebloq.com/html5/truth-about-structuring-html5-page-9122842 seems to be skeptical about the switch to HTML5 and the people responsible for making the "improvements." As a comeplete newbie to the HTML world I found that a lot of the content in this article went right over my head but at the same time I was able to compredhend and learn a few things with one frontend class under my belt. According to the author, HTML5's new structural elements will seem pointless with out understanding document outlines, but at the same time he states that once you do understand them they may seem arbitrary and odd with questionable value while instead of paving cowpaths they "build a new bovine highway to nowhere." The author goes on to talk about how important headings are for blind readers using screen readers. 76% of blind readers navigate by headings when they are available. Basically by naming the section elements: section, article, nav and aside rather than h1-h6 we make it easier for blind readers to interpret websites but at the same time the h1-h6 should not be dismissed and they need to be used when appropriate.</p>
  	<p> I'll be honest, I'm not sure exactly what this means but the author states that there has been a void between the communication as to why the new HTML5 structure designers and developers have no understanding of the outlines they have been using. The release of HTML5 was supposed to make it easier to bring about better document outlines while instead it seems like it has done more harm than good considering no one understands the correct purpose of the new elements, because of this the development community is marking up websites in a way that doesn't adhere to the HTML5 spec simply becuase everyone assumed that's how the new elements are supposed to be used. After reading this article it seems like the author is upset that there is this group of HTML "pros" that have made the specs, but there is a serious disconnect between the "pros" and the users and communicating the reasons for new elements and the correct way to implement them. </p>
