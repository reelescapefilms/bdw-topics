  	<title>HTML Semantics</title>
  <body> 
  	<p>I chose <q>HTML semantics</q> because at first I honestly had no idea what it meant. Now that I have read this http://changelog.ca/log/2006/11/19/what_is_semantic_html blog post I have a basic understanding of what <q>semantics</q> mean when applied to HTML. Basically it means that everything within HTML has a meaning or a purpose in identitfyng content. For example the p means paragraph and the q means quotes and so on.</p>
  	<p> The end of this article was interesting for me because I just read the HTML5 document outline blog post. This semantics article states <q>What if there is no HTML element for what I am trying to say</q> HTML provides the <q>class</q> atribute for this, but after reading the HTML5 document outline blog post, (which I am assuming came out after this semantics article) it states that now with HTML5, certain HTML classes can be defined as an actual element rather than having to use the div or span elements to identify them. For example instead of using div class=footer we now can use the footer element to define a footer. This is the way I comprenhended this, please correct me if I am wrong.</P>
