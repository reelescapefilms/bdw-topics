		<h3> This article by Jeff Star briefly explains the clearfix hack and how it can solve many layout problems without a lot of excess mark up. After reading the article over and over I felt like I had a good grasp on what exactly is happening here. I added a div around the chinook salmon box which I'm assuming directs it to the primary.css file which contains the clearfix information. Here is where I am confused. I added the .clearfix code and refreshed the page and nothing happened. So Obviously I am missing something.</h3>

		<h3> This article by Brad Vin takes a "dummy" approach to explaining the oldschool way to clearfix, the new way, and the "micro clearfix." His dummy approach explaining the different clearfix solutions seem pretty simple and straight forward but I as I attempted to double check my work on the rainforest index.html file I still can't quite put my finger on why my box is not being "clearfixed." </h3>
