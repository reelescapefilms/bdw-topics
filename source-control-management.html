	<h2> Article 1: Wikipedia: Source Control Management   </h2>
	<h2> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control">Wikipedia: Revisions Control</a> </h2>
		<h3> A lame as it may seem, I chose wikepedia's page first becuase as a filmmaker I felt I had a good idea of what Source Control Management is but after looking through a couple articles I decided I don't know jack. So I thought wikipedia could clear it up for me. As I assumed, Source Control Management is the ability to control the multipl revisions of a project. But when it comes to web development it can get a lot more complicated when you have multiple people working on the same project. Wikipedia states that there are Version Control Systems that solve this problem. I am under the assumtion that github will act as our version control system. </h3>

		<h3> This article by Joel on Software gives a great beginners approach to Source Control. Joel states that Source Control allows distributed work in teams of any size, at different locations, while avoiding conflicts, in source code changes. Joel then describes the basic terms associated with Source Control: Repository: the area where the all the files live. Revision: allowing comparision of changes and who has made those changes. Working Copy: A local copy each developer can work on without changing the source file. Branching: a branch is a copy of the main revision which can be merged into other branched and the main source file. Merging: allows re-introducing changes down in a branch back to the main copy. Joel then states some of the benefits of Source Control: 
			<ul>
				<li>Easier backups of one, central location</li>
				<li>Easy development of new features</li>
				<Li>Historical overview of changes</li>
				<li>Access control for revisions</li>
				<li>Conflict resolution of competing changes</li>
			</ul>
		For me it makes perfect sense why Source Control is imperetive. First of all because if you don't have it you are risking losing all your work! Second, it seems like its super important for having multiple people working on the same project.
